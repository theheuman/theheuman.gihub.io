Triggering in-game upon the first Mythic kill of Amirdrassil's final boss, we now know what--and how--to get Fyr'alath The Dreamrender axe, as well as its questline. A warning for Warriors, Paladins, and Death Knights: You're gonna drool all over yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's look at the raw stats and how to start the Fyr'alath the Dreamrender quest--as well as the long, long crafting process involved.\n\n\n\nWhat is Fyr'alath the Dreamrender?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmbued with the power of Shadowflame--the primordial power of both dragon energy and the shadowy Void-- is Fyralath the Dreamrender, axe of Primalist baddie Fyrakk. And now that the big guy's been dropped in Mythic difficulty we now know what the axe itself does.\n\n\n\n\nFyr'alath the Dreamrender\n\n\n\nItem Level 496Binds when picked upTwo-Hand Axe1,764 - 3,665 Damage Speed 3.60(753.9 damage per second)\n\n\n\n+1,002 Strength+4,317 Stamina+394 Critical Strike+667 Haste\n\n\n\nUse: Unleash the Rage of Fyr'alath to charge towards your target and swing repeatedly, dealing 483,904 Shadowflame damage over 3 sec to all who would stand in your way. (2 Min Cooldown)Equip: Your attacks apply Mark of Fyr'alath, dealing 27,054 Shadowflame damage over 15 sec. Upon activation, Fyr'alath draws in the flames from all marks to increase its damage by 10%.\n\n\n\n\nThat's a lot of Shadowflame. And in case you're wondering how to kick this party off right for us normal people, here's how to start the Fyralath the Dreamrender quest and get your mitts on all that flame. Whatcha gonna do with all that flame? Imma get, get, get, get you maimed.\n\n\n\nSorry. That will be the only Fergie reference in this piece.\n\n\n\nStarting the Fyr'alath the Dreamrender quest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour quest to craft this Legendary axe starts with a drop from the boss itself. An item called Fyr'alath the Dreamrender appears, but if you try to equip it the thing tries to kill you with Shadowflame on the spot.","images":{"thumbnail":{"height":150,"url":"https://admin.esports.gg/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/fyralath-axe-quest-150x150.jpg","width":150}},"is_sticky":0,"menu_order":0,"objectID":"324247-0","permalink":"https://admin.esports.gg/news/world-of-warcraft/fyralath-the-dreamrender-axe-quest/","post_author":{"display_name":"Will Jagielski-Harrison","user_id":163,"user_login":"hammerbarn","user_url":"http://www.anchor.fm/azerothpodcast"},"post_date":1701033864,"post_date_formatted":"November 26, 2023","post_excerpt":"\u003cp\u003eMythic Fyrakk is dead and now Fyralath the Dreamrender\u0026#8211;the new Legendary axe\u0026#8211;and its quest appear.
